            <h2>Common Strategies for Correct Score Predictions</h2>
            <p>Strategic betting involves leveraging statistical models and expert analysis. Here are a few popular approaches:</p>
            <h3>1. Expected Goals (xG) Analysis</h3>

            <h3>2. Scoreline Clustering</h3>

            <h3>3. Live Betting Adjustments</h3>
            <p>Correct score markets during live games can offer valuable opportunities based on match dynamics, such as red cards or injuries.</p>
